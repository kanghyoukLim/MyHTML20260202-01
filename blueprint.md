# Application Blueprint

## Overview
A web application that recommends a food menu based on the selected category (Korean, Chinese, Western, Snack) and provides the cooking method (recipe) for the selected dish.

## Current Plan: Menu Recommendation System
**Objective:** Create an interactive page where users select a food category and receive a random menu recommendation with a recipe.

**Features:**
1.  **Category Selection:** Buttons for "Korean" (한식), "Chinese" (중식), "Western" (양식), and "Snack" (분식).
2.  **Random Recommendation:** Logic to randomly select one menu item from the chosen category.
3.  **Recipe Display:** Show the name of the dish and a step-by-step cooking guide.
4.  **External Search Integration:** Direct links to search for the recipe on Naver and YouTube.
5.  **Responsive Design:** Ensure the layout works on mobile and desktop.

**Architecture:**
*   **HTML:** Structure for buttons and result display area.
*   **CSS:** Modern styling with cards, shadows, and responsive layout.
*   **JavaScript:** Data storage for menus/recipes and logic for random selection and DOM manipulation.
